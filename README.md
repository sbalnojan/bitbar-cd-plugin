# BitBar Death Clock Plugin

This BitBar plugin, called "Death Clock" shows two things in your Mac OS X menu bar:

- the days you have left to live
- (optionally) the % progress of this quarter.

and on click it additionally shows:

- the amount of books you will still be able to read in your life
- the 4 year projects you can still complete within the days left.

# Installation

Install https://github.com/matryer/bitbar if you haven't.

Put [DClock.sh](DClock/DClock.sh) into your plugin directory.

Put up your configuration file at ~/.dc_config.cfg in the following format:

```bash
DEATH_DATE_STR="2025-11-07"
BOOKS_A_YEAR=20
```

## Enable Quarter Progress

If you want to additionally show the progress of the current quarter (for instance
because you set yourself OKRs quarterwise), you can do that by adding this line
to your .dc_config.cfg:

```bash
DEATH_DATE_STR="2025-11-07"
BOOKS_A_YEAR=20
QUARTER_PROGRESS=Ttrue
```

where DEATH_DATE_STR denotes your personal death date in %Y-%M-%d format,
and BOOKS_A_YEAR the amount of books you read in a given year.
